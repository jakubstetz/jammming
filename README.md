# 🎧 Jammming

**Jammming** is a React app that connects with the Spotify API to let users:

- Search for songs  
- Build custom playlists  
- Save those playlists directly to their Spotify account  

This was one of my favorite projects during my early full-stack curriculum with Codecademy — the first time I built something that felt like a _real app_. Seeing a playlist I created with my app appear instantly in the Spotify mobile app was a pure dopamine hit.

## 🌱 Purpose

Built to practice API integration, OAuth authentication, and React component design. This project solidified my understanding of JSON requests, controlled components, and how to structure a more complex app interface with stateful flows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React  
- Spotify Web API  
- OAuth 2.0  
- JSX  
- Custom CSS styling  

## ✨ Features

- Login via Spotify OAuth  
- Real-time search for tracks using Spotify’s search endpoint  
- Add and remove tracks to a custom playlist  
- Save playlist to your own Spotify account  

## 🧠 Lessons & Growth

This project gave me my first real taste of:

- Managing app state across components in a multi-step user flow  
- Debugging authorization errors and token handling  
- Using real-world APIs with authentication and data persistence  
- Handling asynchronous user interactions in a clean and intuitive UI
